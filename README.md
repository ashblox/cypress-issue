### Cypress Issue

This repository was created to aid the Cypress team in an issue I created [here](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/17066). The problem was that typings for `cy.contains()` didn't support the option for `includeShadowDom` which could be passed & utilized if using JavaScript.

This was fixed and released in Cypress version 7.7.0.
